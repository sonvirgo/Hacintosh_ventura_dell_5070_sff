Dell 5070 i7-9700

Tired of crappytop, are you?
If you do teaching assistant service for it students, like me do.
Ranging from install hackintosh to Ubuntu setup, varies type of coding, virtual network lab emulation, etc
A decent PC is a must, so I switch my main machine to this Dell Optiples 5070 SFF i7-9700
It is a joke setting up Ventura on it.
Almost everything working
Except DW1560 Bluetooth, it works pefectly in Monterey but not in Ventura
